## 👋 Hi there!

I'm a cloud-focused engineer building efficient, scalable systems on Azure using .NET, DevOps practices, and Infrastructure as Code.

  public string Location = "Copenhagen, Denmark ";
  public string[] Skills = new[] { "C#", ".NET", "Azure", "React", "Bicep", "CI/CD" };

}

## Professional Experience

I design secure, scalable cloud platforms for fintech and healthcare, high-throughput systems, regulated workloads and multi-region architectures with zero-downtime deployment. My work sits at the intersection of Azure architecture, backend engineering, and DevOps, with a strong focus on reliability, security and clear, maintainable system design.

If you need someone who actually knows how to build software end-to-end  from writing solid .NET code to shipping reliable, production-ready cloud systems  thats exactly where I deliver the most impact.

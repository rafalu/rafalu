## 👋 Hi there!

I'm a cloud-focused engineer building efficient, scalable systems on Azure using .NET, DevOps practices, and Infrastructure as Code.

```csharp
class RafalUlatowski : CloudEngineer
{
  public string Location = "Copenhagen, Denmark ";
  public string[] Skills = new[] { "C#", ".NET", "Azure", "React", "Bicep", "CI/CD" };

  public string CurrentFocus() => "Building cloud platforms and optimizing distributed systems for performance and reliability";
}
```

## Technical Skills

- **Cloud & Azure**
  App Services, Functions, Service Bus, Event Grid, Storage, VNETs, Private Endpoints, Networking, Monitoring

- **.NET / C#**
  Distributed systems, microservices, REST APIs, integration patterns, async messaging, high-availability workloads

- **Full-Stack (React / Next.js)**
  React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, API integration, SSR/SSG, component architecture, modern UI tooling — enough to build complete, production-ready frontends end-to-end

- **DevOps**
  Bicep, modular IaC, environment orchestration, Azure DevOps Pipelines, Containers, Docker, container registries, automated deployments, release strategies

- **Architecture**
  Cloud solution design, scalable topologies, event-driven systems, reliability patterns, cost optimization

## Professional Experience

I design secure, scalable cloud platforms for fintech and healthcare, high-throughput systems, regulated workloads and multi-region architectures with zero-downtime deployment. My work sits at the intersection of Azure architecture, backend engineering, and DevOps, with a strong focus on reliability, security and clear, maintainable system design.

If you need someone who actually knows how to build software end-to-end  from writing solid .NET code to shipping reliable, production-ready cloud systems  thats exactly where I deliver the most impact.
